      "full": "The **leak** (pronounced \\\"LAY-ahk,\\\" also spelled **leyak** or **liak**) is one of Bali's most feared and fascinating supernatural entities. Unlike simple ghosts or demons, the leak represents a complex figure existing at the intersection of human and supernatural, witch and spirit, living practitioner and undead creature. The leak is simultaneously a living person who practices black magic (*ilmu hitam*) and the supernatural form that person's spirit assumes, particularly at night. In Balinese cosmology, which emphasizes balance between opposing forces, the leak represents the dark, chaotic, destructive aspect of spiritual power. While Bali is famous for its beautiful temples, elaborate ceremonies, and harmonious culture, the leak tradition reveals the island's sophisticated understanding of the shadow side of existence—the necessary presence of evil that balances good, chaos that complements order, death that gives meaning to life. The leak is fundamentally different from the toyol/tuyul (a spirit servant used to steal), which is a separate entity entirely. Where the toyol is essentially a enslaved child spirit or homunculus used by practitioners for theft, the leak is the practitioner themselves transformed, or an independent malevolent entity. The leak is not primarily concerned with stealing money but with causing illness, death, disruption, and terror. Leak take many forms: a disembodied flying head trailing organs (*penanggalan*-like), a fireball streaking through the night sky, a naked old woman with impossibly long tongue and pendulous breasts, a grotesque animal, or invisible spirit. They haunt cemeteries, crossroads, and lonely places, attacking the vulnerable, devouring infants, spreading disease, and serving as instruments of black magic practitioners who wish harm on their enemies. The belief in leak is not mere superstition but an integral part of Balinese Hindu cosmology and social structure. Understanding leak requires understanding Balinese concepts of power, magic, social order, and the constant negotiation between opposing cosmic forces."
